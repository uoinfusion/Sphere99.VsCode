# SphereServer 0.99

SphereServer 0.99 is very old and long dead branch of [SphereServer 0.56](https://github.com/Sphereserver/Source). It is notoriously difficult to port scripts from old version 0.99 to the newer and still active 0.56. The task is nearly impossible when you have hundreds of thousands lines of code to rewrite. So there is at least one active shard still running this ancient piece of software.

This is a a syntax highlighting extension for Visual Studio Code that makes scripting for SphereServer 0.99 a little bit less painful.
